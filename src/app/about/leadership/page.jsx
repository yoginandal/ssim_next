      `Late. Sri S.P. Sampathy the founder of the Siva Sivani Group of Educational Institutions, was drawn towards imparting education by a twist of fate in 1961, when he started a school in a rented building in Sanathnagar. With a paltry amount of money in his pocket, our illustrious Founder braved all odds to establish and leave behind an empire with several thousand pupils across the globe and contributing their tiny bit towards the peace, progress and prosperity of the human society at large. In the words of Sri. S. P. Sampathy himself: "Being the Founder of this group and having a major role to play in its growth, my personality and mind-set have become one with that of the institution."`,
      "Sri S.P. Sampathy believed that teamwork is the backbone of the colossal success that he achieved and discipline is its most important ingredient. Our founder was a man with a vision and believed that nothing is impossible for those who think they can.",
      "Siva Sivani Institute of Management was started in 1992 with approval from the All India Council for Technical Education, Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. SSIM is pioneer in early technology adopters.

      "Over a period of nearly six decades, Sri S.P. Sampathy and his organisation have contributed their mite towards making the Country and the World a better place to live in. There is no district in Andhra Pradesh, no state in India and no Country in the World where the alumni of Siva Sivani have not made their presence felt. There is no profession or sector from education to law, engineering to medicine, life sciences to social sciences, defence to business, Government to Private where the indelible stamp of Siva Sivani has not left its mark.",
      "During his life time, Sri S.P .Sampathy held a lot of Honorary posts and recipient of the Arch of Excellence Award presented by her Excellency Smt. Kumud Ben Johsi to Sri S.P.Sampathy.",
      "The saga of this noble soul came to an abrupt end on the 11th of February 2005.",
      "The legacy left behind by Sri S.P. Sampathy in striving for the cause of education is unparalleled and a daunting task for his successors in office. It is probably one in millions of people who strives all his life for a noble cause, build an organization worth millions of times than the initial capital invested, brave all odds and leave the material world with not an inch of land to call their own.",
      "We at Siva Sivani Institute of Management dedicate ourselves to working towards the realization of the dreams of our great Founder Late. Sri S.P. Sampathy.",
